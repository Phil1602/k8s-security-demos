# Allowing IPs 10.0.0.0/8 might not include API server, even when the "kubernetes" service is within this range.
# It depends on the actual IP address that is resolved behind the service.
# On GKE this is an external IP.
# So find out the IP as follows and replace "0.0.0.0/0" by it: 
# kubectl get endpoints --namespace default kubernetes
# See 
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/56494510/1845976
# "0.0.0.0/0" is only a workaround. It allows all egress. Works everywhere but does not adhere least privilege principle.

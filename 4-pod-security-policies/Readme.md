You can choose between the interactive demo:

```bash
cd demo
./interactive-demo.sh
```

Note if you got [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) on your path, the output will prettier.

Alternatively, you could print a transcript of the demo for doing the demo manually

```bash
cd demo
PRINT_ONLY=true ./interactive-demo.sh
```

# Kubernetes Security Demos

The following demos showcase several Kubernetes security features.

Initially, these demos were developed during the preparation for some talks on [Kubernetes appOps Security](https://github.com/cloudogu/k8s-appops-security-talks) and our [K8s application security training](https://cloudogu.com/en/trainings/).

See also our [series of blog posts](#blog-posts) on the topic.

Tested to run on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with a local Linux machine.
Should also work on Mac.

1. ~~Role Based Access Controll (RBAC)~~ - RBAC has now been default for years. A showcase for the downsides of ABAC seems obsolted. If you're interested check [git history](https://github.com/cloudogu/k8s-security-demos/tree/b94aa0a94358cc04f3f1beed80f755ac14b994da)
2. [Network Policies](2-network-policies/Readme.md)
3. [Security Context](3-security-context/Readme.md)
4. [Pod Security Policies](4-pod-security-policies/Readme.md)

# Setting up the clusters

This demos should run on most kubernetes clusters that have support for network policies and PodSecurityPolicies.

This repo also features setting up a defined environment Google Kubernetes engine. 
You can set it using [createCluster.sh](createCluster.sh).  
It uses terraform to roll out the clusters. If you prefer a bash-only variant, check check [git history](https://github.com/cloudogu/k8s-security-demos/tree/b94aa0a94358cc04f3f1beed80f755ac14b994da).

In order to use the script

* set up a service account and a bucket for terraform.  
  Export the service account to `terraform/account.json`
* set your GKE `ZONE` and `PROJECT` and a bucket `TERRAFORM_BUCKET` for terraform to store its state in `config.sh`  
  (alternatively, you can set these properties via env vars).  
  Note that you can also set `CLUSTER_VERSION` (like `1.11`) and  `MACHINE_TYPE` (like `n1-standard-2`).
  From time to time GKE drops support for older cluster versions, so you might need to set a newer one, if the one in 
  `config.sh` is no longer supported at the time of execution. 
* Terraform calls [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) at the end in order to at the cluster credentials to your kubeconfig.
* Have terraform installed (should work with 0.12 and 0.13)
* Call `create Cluster.sh`
* Terraform will ask for confirmation before executing. 

## Deleting clusters 

You can delete the cluster and those entries once you're done using the `delete-clusters.sh` script. 

## Costs 

For just a quick create, demo, delete action the cost should be < 10$.
The total infra cost for initially creating these demos was about 10$. 

# Running the demos

Each demo is contained in its own sub folder, where each contains a 
 
* `apply.sh` that deploys the applications required for the demos and
* `README.md` that contains the steps of the demo

Note that the scripts also create entries to your `/etc/hosts`.

All Demos run inside the same cluster. 

# Credentials

If not otherwise stated, the login credentials for the webapps are

* User: `admin`
* Password: `12345` 

It's a demo after all! ðŸ˜‰

# Blog Posts

The examples evolved further while working on an article series called "Kubernetes AppOps Security" published in German Magazin JavaSPEKTRUM. Both English translation and German original can be found on the Cloudogu Blog.
